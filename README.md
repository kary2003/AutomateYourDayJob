# Automate Your Day Job with Python

## Python Basics

### Before You Begin

1. create a new GitHub repo called automateYourDayJob. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. In your local git repository, create a directory for: !

    * [PyBank](https://github.com/kary2003/AutomateYourDayJob/blob/master/PyBank/Budget_Data_M.ipynb)
    * [PyRamen](https://github.com/kary2003/AutomateYourDayJob/blob/master/PyRamen/pyramen.ipynb)
    
3. In each folder you just created, add a new file called main.ipynb. Remember that to create this file you will need to use JupyterLab to correctly generate the .ipynb file format. This will be the main notebook to run for each analysis.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub.
